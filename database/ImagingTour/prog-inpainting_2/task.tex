\textbf{Image Inpainting}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Download the file \texttt{noisy\_image.npy} (link ``data'' next to the link ``Sheet 11'') and use \texttt{numpy.load()} to import it into your Python script. The shape is (823, 1238). This image is obtained from the original image by randomly setting 99\% (!) of the pixel values to zero (=black).
	\item Apply the techniques from the lecture to recover the original image:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Estimate the applied masking matrix $A$ from the given noisy image.
		\item Solve a regularized least squares problem. Note that the solving step may take a few seconds due to the high--dimensional data.
	\end{enumerate}
	(Can you identify the objects on the image?)
\end{enumerate}
