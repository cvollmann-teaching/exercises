\textbf{Linear Modeling}\\
Let us assume a car $c_1$ starts driving at time $t=0h$ and runs with 50$\frac{km}{h}$. A second car $c_2$ runs with $90\frac{km}{h}$ but starts 2 hours later at time $t=2h$ at the same position as car $c_1$ did.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Describe the positions $c_1(t)$ and $c_2(t)$ of the cars as affine linear function of time, i.e., $c_i(t) = m_i t + b_i$ for some appropriate $m_i, b_i \in \mathbb{R}$, $i = 1,2$.
	\item At which time $t$ do the cars meet? 
\end{enumerate}
