\begin{enumerate}
	\item For example:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[i)] 
		Let $A$ have independent columns ("full column rank").\\
		This is equivalent to $\underbrace{\text{ker}(A)}_{\textcolor{blue}{=\text{ker}(A^TA)}}=\{0\}$, thus also the columns of $A^TA$ are independent, which implies that $A^TA$ is invertible.
		\item[ii)] Let 	$A^TA$ be positive definite.\\
		Then its eigenvalues are strictly positive. Since $A^TA$ is symmetric we can use its eigendecomposition to conclude that $A^TA$ is invertible.
	\end{enumerate}
