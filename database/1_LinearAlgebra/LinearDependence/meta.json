    "solution": "{\n\\color{solution}\nTake for example \n$$\nA := [a_1, a_2, a_3] := \\begin{pmatrix}\n\t  1 & 0 &1\\\\\n\t  1 & 0 &1\\\\\n\t  0 & 1 &1\\\\\n\t  0 & 1 &1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n~~~\\text{and}~~~\nx := \\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\1\\\\-1\n\\end{pmatrix}.\n$$\nConstruction recipe: We take two random vectors $x, y$ and form a simple linear combination $x+y$. We know these vectors are linearly dependent, so that we can take those as columns for the example matrix, i.e.,\n$$x + y - (x+y) = 0 ~~~\\text{gives}~~~[x, y, (x+y)] \\begin{pmatrix}\n1\\\\1\\\\-1\n\\end{pmatrix} = 0.$$\n}\n",
