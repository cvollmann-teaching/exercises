\textbf{Copper, Silver and Gold Alloys}\\
	Let us assume we are given the alloys $M_1$, $M_2$ and $M_3$, which are built of copper, silver and gold with the following percental proportions:
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{r|ccc}
			~		&$M_1$ &$M_2$&$M_3$\\
			\hline  
			Copper	&20 &70&50\\
			Silver	&60 &10&50\\	
			Gold	&20 &20&0\\		
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	Is it possible to mix these alloys to form a new alloy which consists of 40\% copper, 50\% silver and 10\% gold.\\~\\
