 Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $r:=\text{rank}(A)$. Assume you are given a singular value decomposition 
 $U \Sigma V^\top = A$, where the 
 entries on the diagonal of $\Sigma$ are given in a descending order.
 \begin{enumerate}
 	\item Use the SVD to write $A$ as a sum of rank--$1$ matrices.
 	\item Let $k \leq r$. Denote the best rank-$k$ approximation of $A$, i.e., give a formula for the matrix
 	$$A_k = \arg \min_{B \in  \mathbb{R}^{m \times n},~ \text{rank}(B)=k  } \|B-A\|_F.$$ 
 	\item Find a singular value decomposition of $A^\top$ and give a basis for $\text{Im}(A)$ and $\text{Im}(A^\top)$.	From that derive $\text{rank}(A^\top)$.	
 	\item Determine the pseudoinverse $A^+$ of $A$ with the help of the SVD. 
 	\item What is the pseudoinverse of $A = \begin{pmatrix}
 	2 & 0\\0&0
 	\end{pmatrix}?$
 	\item Assume that $A$ is symmetric (thus $m=n$) and positive definite. What is the relation between its singular values and its eigenvalues? What is the pseudoinverse in this case?
 \end{enumerate}
