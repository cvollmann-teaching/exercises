	\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition 
	$U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, where the 
	entries on the diagonal of $\Sigma$ are given in a descending order.
	Denote the best rank-$k$ approximation of $A$ for $k \leq \min\{m,n\}$ and denote the criterion with respect to which this is the best approximation. 
	\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition (SVD) $U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. Find a singular value decomposition of $A^\top$ and give a basis for $\text{Im}(A)$ and $\text{Im}(A^\top)$.
	\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition (SVD)
	$U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. Determine the pseudoinverse $A^+$ of $A$ with the help of the SVD. Explain why $A^+ = A^{-1}$, if $A$ is invertible (\textit{hint:} note that $m=n$ in this case).
\item Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a symmetric and positive definite matrix. What is the relation between its singular values and its eigenvalues?
\item Denote the optimization problem which is related to the principal component analysis.
\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition (SVD)
$U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, where the 
entries on the diagonal of $\Sigma$ are given in a descending order. Use the SVD to write $A$ as a sum of rank--$1$ matrices and for some $k \leq \text{rank}(A)$ denote the best rank-$k$ approximation of $A$ in terms of the Frobenius norm.
