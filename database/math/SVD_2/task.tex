{\color{red}	Consider the matrix
	$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
	1&1
	\end{pmatrix}.$$
\begin{enumerate}
		\item Derive its singular value decomposition.
		\item Compute $U\Sigma V^T = A$ to check your result.
		\item Write $A$ as a sum of rank-1 matrices.
		\item Is $A$ invertible? Explain your answer.
\end{enumerate}
%\textit{Hint:} Recall that $U$ is the matrix having the \textit{normalized} eigenvectors of $AA^T$ as columns, $V$ is the matrix having the \textit{normalized} eigenvectors of $A^TA$ as columns.
