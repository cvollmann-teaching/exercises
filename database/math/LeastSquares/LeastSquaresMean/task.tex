\textbf{\normalsize Linear Least Squares}

We are given a sample of size $m$ of measurements $(z_i,y_i)\in\mathbb{R}^2$ for $i=1,\dots,m$. 
Determine the minimizer $c_0$ of the problem
\begin{align*}
\min \limits_{c_0\in\mathbb{R}} \sum_{i=1}^m (c_0 - y_i)^2.
\end{align*}
\textit{Hint: } This is the simple case where our assumed model is a constant function, i.e., $f(z_i) \equiv c_0$. Set up the design matrix $A$ and solve the normal equation.
