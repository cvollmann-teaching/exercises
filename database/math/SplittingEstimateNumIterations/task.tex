\section{Estimate Number of Iterations}
Consider the linear system $Ax=b$ with
$$A=\begin{pmatrix}
3&-1\\-1&3
\end{pmatrix}.$$

Assume you want to solve this system with the Richardson, Jacobi and Gau√ü-Seidel method, respectively, without relaxation ($\theta = 1$). Estimate the number $m$ of iterations that are needed for each method (if convergent) to reduce the error by a factor of $\varepsilon=10^{-6}$, i.e.,
	$$\|x_k-x\|_2 \leq \varepsilon\|x_0-x\|_2.$$
	\textit{Hint: }Use the error estimate from previous exercises. You can later numerically verify your results.
