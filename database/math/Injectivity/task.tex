\section{Result for Injective Funtions}
Let $f: X \rightarrow Y$ be an injective function and $A,B \subset X$. Please show that
\begin{align*}
f(A) \cap f(B) = f(A \cap B).
\end{align*}
\textit{Hint:} Split up the equality ``$=$'' into the parts ``$\subset$'' and  ``$\supset$''. One direction is straightforward the other one requires, that $f$ is injective.
