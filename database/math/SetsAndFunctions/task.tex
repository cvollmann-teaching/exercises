\section{Sets and Functions}
Let $A, B$ be finite sets which contain the same number of elements, i.e., $|A| = |B|$ and let $f: A \rightarrow B$ be a function. Please show that
	the following statements are equivalent.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $f$ is injective
		\item $f$ is surjective
		\item $f$ is bijective
	\end{enumerate}
		\textit{Hint:} (iii) follows immediately from (i) $\Leftrightarrow$ (ii).
