\textbf{\normalsize The SVD of Symmetric Matrices}

Let $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ be symmetric with eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_n \in \R$.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What are the singular values of $A$?
	\item How does the SVD look like? What can you say about the SVD if in addition $A$ is positive definite?
	\item \textit{Optional:} Give a representation of the condition and rank of $A$ in terms of its eigenvalues.
%		\item Give a representation of the condition and rank of $A$ in terms of its eigenvalues.
