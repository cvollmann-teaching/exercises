We know from the lecture that the angle $\\alpha$ between two vectors $a,c$ is defined by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos(\\alpha) = \\frac{a^\\top c}{\\| a\\|_2 \\|c \\|_2}.\n\\end{align*}\nUse this equality to compute the height $\\| b \\|_2$ of the tree in the figure below. The angle $\\alpha := 36.87^{\\circ}$ and the distance to the tree $ a := (4, 0)^\\top$ are given.\n\n\\includegraphics[scale=.6,trim={8cm 15cm 2cm 2cm}, clip]{4_Sheet_Cosine.pdf}\n",
