Answer the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the purpose of the $QR$ Algorithm? Write down its iteration instruction.
	\item Let $R=(r_{ij})_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a (lower or upper) triangular matrix with $r_{nn} = 0$. Is $R$ invertible? Explain your answer.			
	\item Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a symmetric matrix. Can we generally say that the singular values of $A$ are equal to its eigenvalues? Explain your answer.		
	\item What is the definition of an orthogonal matrix? What does it mean for the columns of the matrix?
	\item Consider the iteration $x_{k+1} = Mx_k + b$ for some matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ and vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$. Name a sufficient condition for the convergence of this sequence. What is the limit in this case?
\end{enumerate}
