Answer the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How is \textit{injectivity} of a function $f\colon X \to Y$ defined?
	%
	\item How is a \textit{scalar product} $P\colon \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \mapsto \mathbb{R}$ defined?
	%
	\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition (SVD)
	$U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$. Determine the pseudoinverse $A^+$ of $A$ with the help of the SVD. Proof that $A^+ = A^{-1}$, if $A$ is invertible (\textit{hint:} note that $m=n$ in this case).
	
	\item Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a matrix. Are the notions of
	injectivity and surjectivity of $A$ equivalent? Give a short justification.
	
	\item What is the normal equation? Where is it applied?
	
	\item Give an example of a vector space other than $\mathbb{R}^n$? 
	
	\item Let $V$ be a vector space over the field $\mathbb{F}$. Give the definition of a basis.
