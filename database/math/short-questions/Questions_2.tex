Answer the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What does the dimension formula say?
	
	\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition (SVD) $U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ with $\text{rank}(A)=r$. {\tiny }Find a singular value decomposition of $A^\top$ as well as a basis for $\text{Im}(A)$ and $\text{Im}(A^\top)$, respectively.
	
	\item Let $R=(r_{ij})_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a (lower or upper) triangular matrix with $r_{nn} = 0$. Is $R$ invertible? Explain your answer.
	\item What is the definition of an orthogonal matrix? What does it mean for the columns of the matrix?
%	\item What is the purpose of the Richardson iteration? Write down its iteration instruction. When does it converge?
	\item What is the purpose of the $QR$ Algorithm? Write down its iteration instruction.
	
%	\item Let  $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ have independent columns and let $b \in \mathbb{R}^{m}$. How can we use the $QR$-decomposition of $A$ to solve the least squares problem $
%	\min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n } \| Ax - b \|_2^2$ ?
	
	\item Draw the sets $\{x \in \mathbb{R}^{2} \colon \|x\|_p = 1   \}$ for $p=1,2,\infty$.
