Answer the following questions.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item How is a \textit{norm} $L: \mathbb{F}^n \to [0, \infty)$ defined?
	
	\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition 
	$U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, where the 
	entries on the diagonal of $\Sigma$ are given in a descending order.
	Denote the best rank-$k$ approximation of $A$ for $k \leq \min\{m,n\}$ and denote the criterion with respect to which this is the best approximation.
	
	
	\item Give an example for a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 2}$ where the LU-decomposition algorithm
	necessarily needs a permutation step.
	
	\item Let $\lambda_1 \neq \lambda_2$ be two eigenvalues of a \textit{symmetric} matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, and let 
	$v_1, v_2 \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be corresponding eigenvectors. Proof that $v_1^\top v_2 = 0$.
	
	\item How is positive definiteness of a matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ defined? What does this mean for the angle
	between a vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$ and the vector $z := Ax$?
