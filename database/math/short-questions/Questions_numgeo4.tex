Answer the following questions or prove the following statements.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the purpose of the $QR$ Algorithm? Write down its iteration instruction.
%	\item What is the purpose of the $QR$ Algorithm? Write down its iteration instruction.
	\item Let $R=(r_{ij})_{ij} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a (lower or upper) triangular matrix with $r_{11} = 0$. Is $R$ invertible? Explain your answer.	
	\item Let $V$ be a subspace  of $\mathbb{F}^n$. Give the definition of a basis and the dimension of $V$.		
	\item Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ be a symmetric matrix and positive definite matrix. What is the relation between its singular values and its eigenvalues?
	\item What is the definition of an orthogonal matrix? What does it mean for the columns of the matrix?
	\item Let $A \in  \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be any matrix. Show that $A^TA$ is symmetric and positive semi-definite.
	\item Assume you are given the singular value decomposition 
$U \Sigma V^\top = A$ of some matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, where the 
entries on the diagonal of $\Sigma$ are given in a descending order. Use the SVD to write $A$ as a sum of rank--$1$ matrices and for some $k \leq \text{rank}(A)$ denote the best rank-$k$ approximation of $A$ in terms of the Frobenius norm.
