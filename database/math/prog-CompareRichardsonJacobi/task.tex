\section{Compare Richardson and Jacobi}
\vspace{-0.5cm}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 	Implement a function \verb|iter_solve()| which takes as arguments a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, a vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^ {n}$ and a parameter $\theta$,
		and returns an approximate solution of the problem $Ax = b$ after performing $m \in \mathbb{N}$ steps of the \textit{Richardson}-iteration.
		\item Add the \textit{Jacobi}-iteration by adding an additional input \verb|method| to your function so that the user can choose between the solvers.
		\item Test your two solvers for some invertible matrix $A\in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 3}$, some $b\in \mathbb{R}^3$ and $m = 50$. In both cases, plot the distance $\| x^k - x^*\|$ to the solution $x^*$ (of \verb|numpy.linalg.solve()|) for each iterate $k=1,\dots,m$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\textit{Hint: } Of course, it can happen that the algorithm does not converge. Use small values for $\theta$ in (i) and matrices with large values
	on the diagonal (compared to its other entries) in (ii). This will assure that $\rho(I-NA)<1$.
