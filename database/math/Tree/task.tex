\section{Height of a tree}
Let $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}^2$ be vectors as illustrated in the figure below. We know from the lecture that the angle $\alpha$ between two vectors $a,c$ is defined by
\begin{align*}
\cos(\alpha) = \frac{a^\top c}{\| a\|_2 \|c \|_2}.
\end{align*}
Use this equality to compute the height $\| b \|_2$ of the tree in the figure below. The angle $\alpha := 36.87^{\circ}$ and the distance to the tree $ a := (4, 0)^\top$ are given.\\
