\textbf{Operation Count: Classical Gram Schmidt Algorithm}

Consider the classical Gram-Schmidt Algorithm for a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ with $\ker(A) = \{0\}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Count each addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root that is computed in the classical Gram Schmidt algorithm to obtain a \textit{reduced} $QR$ factorization of $A$. 
\end{enumerate}
