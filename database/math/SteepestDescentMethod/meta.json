What is the solution $x^* = A^{-1}b$ here?\n\t\t\\item[ii)] Recycle your code from Sheet 8 (see \\verb|iter_solve()|) and run the Richardson iteration for the above setting; once with the optimal $\\hat{\\theta}$ and once with a $\\theta$ which is almost too large to gaurantee convergence. Extent your code to the \\textit{method of steepest descent} \\eqref{steepest_descent_method} by choosing the stepsize $\\theta_k$ from \\eqref{steepest_descent_stepsize} in each iteration step and apply it to the above setting. Plot the iterates $x_k$ for all the three runs into the same 2d plot (use three different colors).\\\\ Also, plot the function values $f(x_k) = \\frac{1}{2} x_k^TAx_k - b^Tx_k$ for each iterate of the three runs into a second plot (use three different colors).\n\t\\end{itemize}",
