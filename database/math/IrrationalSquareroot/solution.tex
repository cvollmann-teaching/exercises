{\color{solution}
	\textbf{Proof} We prove the assumption by contradiction.
	Let us assume $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{Q}.$ Therefore there are $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $a,b$ are relatively prime (i.e. their greatest common divisor is 1) and
	$\sqrt{2} = \frac{b}{a}$. \\
%	
	We see that $2a^2  = b^2$ which implies that $b^2$, and therefore $b$, are even. That means there is a $c \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $b = 2c$. This implies that
	$2a^2 = 4 c^2$ which tells us that $a^2 = 2 c^2$. Hence, $a^2$ and therefore $a$ are even. That contradicts the assumption that $a,b$ are relatively prime. Therefore $\sqrt{2}$ is not an element of $\mathbb{Q}$.
