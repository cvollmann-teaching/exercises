\section{Heron's Method as Newton's Method}
Consider the function $f\colon \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R},~f(x):= x^2 -a$ for some nonnegative number $a\geq 0$.  Apply Newton's method to the nonlinear system $f(x)=0$ (root finding problem). Compare the resulting iterative scheme to Heron's algorithm from earlier sheets.
