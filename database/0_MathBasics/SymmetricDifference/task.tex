\textbf{Symmetric Difference}\\
Let $X$ be a set and $A,B \subset X$ be two subsets of $X$. The symmetric difference of $A$ and $B$ is then defined by
	\begin{align*}
	A \Delta B := (A \cap {B}^c) \cup (B \cap {A}^c).
	\end{align*}
	Please show that 
	\begin{align*}
	A \Delta B = (A \cup B) \cap {(A \cap B)^c}.
	\end{align*}
\textit{Hint: }Use the De Morgan's rule and exploit the following distributive laws:
$$A \cap (B\cup C) = (A\cap B) \cup (A \cap C)~~~\text{and}~~~A \cup (B\cap C) = (A\cup B) \cap (A \cup C) .$$
