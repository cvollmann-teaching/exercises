That means there is a $c \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $b = 2c$. This implies that\n\t$2a^2 = 4 c^2$ which tells us that $a^2 = 2 c^2$. Hence, $a^2$ and therefore $a$ are even. That contradicts the assumption that $a,b$ are relatively prime. Therefore $\\sqrt{2}$ is not an element of $\\mathbb{Q}$.\n\t\\hfill $\\square$\n}",
