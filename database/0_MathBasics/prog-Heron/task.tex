\textbf{Heron's algorithm}

For a nonnegative number $a\ge 0$ compute the square root $\sqrt{a}$ up to an error of $10^{-10}$. For this purpose, use the following iteration:
$$ x_{n+1}=\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x_n^2+a}{x_n}\right) \nonumber.$$ 
Choose different initial values $x_0$ and observe the convergence behavior by printing the error $|x_n-\sqrt{a}|$ in each iteration step.

\textit{Hint:} Use a while-loop for the iteration (\verb|while|) and the built-in function \verb|abs| as well as the Python value \verb|a ** 0.5| to compute the error $|x_n-\sqrt{a}|$ in each iteration step.
