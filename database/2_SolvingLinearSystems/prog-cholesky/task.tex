\textbf{The Cholesky Decomposition for SPD Matrices}
%\textit{\color{red} More info during next class (May 18).}
%	For symmetric and positive definite (spd) matrices $A\in \Rnn$ one can obtain the following improvement over the $LU$-decomposition:
%$$A=LL^T,$$
%where $L\in\Rnn$ is a lower triangular matrix if posit(i.e., $U=L^T$).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Find SciPy routines to perform the Cholesky factorization and solution steps separately. Non-obligatory: Implement them on your own (algorithms can be found on Wikipedia).
	\item Compare the performance of the Cholesky routines to the $LU$ routines from SciPy by testing them on large symmetric and positive definite matrices $A \in \Rnn$ (e.g., $A = B^TB + \delta I$ for some random $B\in \Rnn$ and $\delta >0$) and some (random) right-hand side $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 
\end{enumerate}
