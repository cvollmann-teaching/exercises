Non-obligatory: Implement them on your own (algorithms can be found on Wikipedia).\n\t\\item Compare the performance of the Cholesky routines to the $LU$ routines from SciPy by testing them on large symmetric and positive definite matrices $A \\in \\Rnn$ (e.g., $A = B^TB + \\delta I$ for some random $B\\in \\Rnn$ and $\\delta >0$) and some (random) right-hand side $b \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$. \n\\end{enumerate}",
