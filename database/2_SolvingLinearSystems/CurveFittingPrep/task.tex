\textbf{Curve Fitting}\\
Assume you were given the following data:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{l|c c c}
	z&-1&0&1\\
	\hline
	y&-1&3&1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Polynomial Interpolation:}\\
	Find coefficients $c_i \in \mathbb{R}$ for the following parabola (polynomial of degree $2$)
	$$f(z) = c_0 + c_1z + c_2z^2,$$
	such that $f(z_i) = y_i$ for all three measurements $i=1,2,3$ from the table above. Therefore, set up and solve a linear system of the form $Ax = b$, where $x=(c_0, c_1, c_2)$. Draw the measurements and the parabola into one plot.
	~\\~\\
	\item \textbf{Univariate Linear Regression:}\\
	Now assume a linear model of the form	
	$$f(z) = c_0 + c_1z.$$
	Consider $x = (c_0, c_1)$. Determine a matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, such that
	$$\sum_{i=1}^3 (f(z_i) - y_i)^2 = \|Ax-b\|_2^2. $$
	Solve the least squares problem
		\begin{align*}
	\min \limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^2} \|Ax-b\|_2^2,
	\end{align*}
	to determine the coefficients $x = (c_0, c_1)$ by solving the \textit{normal equation} (explanation follows later in the lecture)
	$$A^TAx = A^Tb. $$
	Draw the measurements and the straight line into one plot.
\end{enumerate}
