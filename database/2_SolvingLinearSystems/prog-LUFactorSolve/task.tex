\section{Solving (Square) Linear System using $LU$ decomposition: Factor and Solve}
Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. Then there exists an invertible lower triangular matrix $L\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with $1$'s on the diagonals, a matrix $U\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ in row echelon form and a permutation matrix $P\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, such that $$PA = LU. $$

\textbf{Tasks:}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Factorization:} Implement a function \verb|factor_lu(A)| which computes the $LU$ decomposition of a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$. It shall output two \verb|numpdy.ndarray|`s of shape \verb|(n,n)|. One is \verb|lu| which on the lower triangular part (excluding the diagonal) contains the information of $L$ and on the upper triangular part (including the diagonal) contains the information for $U$. The other is \verb|piv| which is the permutation matrix $P$.

	\textit{Hints: } 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item You can recycle previous codes.
	\end{itemize}
	

	\item \textbf{Solving:} Implement a function \verb|solve_lu(Lu, P, b)| which takes as input the \verb|numpy.ndarray|'s \verb|Lu| and \verb|P| computed by \verb|factor_lu(A)| as well as a vector $b \in \mathbb{R}^{n}$. It shall then apply the three-stage solving procedure presented in the lecture and output the solution $x$ of $Ax=b$.
	
	
	\textit{Hints: } 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recall the solving procedure:
	  \begin{itemize}
			\normalsize
			\item[1)] permute right hand side $\bar{b}=Pb$
			\item[2)] solve lower triangular system $Lz=\bar{b}$ for $z$
			\item[3)] solve upper triangular system $Ux=z$ for $x$
		\end{itemize}
		\item For steps 2) and 3) you can use your function \verb|solve_tri(A, b, lower)| from Ex. 2.
	\end{itemize}

	\item \textbf{Test} your routine on an example.
\end{enumerate}
