\textbf{**Bonus:** Operation Count in Classical Gram Schmidt Algorithm}

Consider the classical Gram-Schmidt algorithm for a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ with $\ker(A) = \{0\}$. \\
Count each addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and square root that is computed in the classical Gram Schmidt algorithm to obtain a \textit{reduced} $QR$ factorization of $A$.
