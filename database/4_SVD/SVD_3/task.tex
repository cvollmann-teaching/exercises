	Consider the matrix
	$$A = \begin{pmatrix}
	\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} &-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\\
	1&1
	\end{pmatrix}.$$	
\begin{enumerate}
		\item Derive its singular value decomposition (SVD).\\
	   (\textit{Hint:} Compute $U\Sigma V^T$ to check your result.)
		\item Write $A$ as a sum of rank-1 matrices by using the singular values and vectors.
		\item Is $A$ invertible? Use the SVD to answer this question.
\end{enumerate}
%\textit{Hint:} Recall that $U$ is the matrix having the \textit{normalized} eigenvectors of $AA^T$ as columns, $V$ is the matrix having the \textit{normalized} eigenvectors of $A^TA$ as columns.
